# Edit with Shell Command

Leverage your favourite shell commands to edit text.

## Features

* Edit the selected text by piping it through shell commands.
  The same text is also available as an environment variable, `ES_SELECTED`.
* The path of the current file is available as an environment variable, `ES_FILEPATH`.
* Insert the output of shell commands at the cursor position.
* Records command history: you can edit and reuse past commands.
* Use the shell you like. For example, if you have Bash on Windows, you can specify Bash as your shell for this extension.
* Register up to 25 quick commands that can be invoked by keyboard shortcuts.
* Support multi cursors.

## Request Features or Report Bugs

Feature requests and bug reports are very welcome: https://github.com/ryu1kn/vscode-edit-with-shell/issues

A couple of requests from me when you raise an github issue.

* **Requesting a feature:** Please try to provide the context of why you want the feature. Such as, in what situation the feature could help you and how, or how the lack of the feature is causing an inconvenience to you. I can't think of introducing it until I understand how it helps you ðŸ™‚
* **Reporting a bug:** Please include environment information (OS name/version, the editor version). Also consider providing screenshots (or even videos) where appropriate. They are often very very helpful!

## Commands

* `EditWithShell: Run command` (**Command ID:** `editWithShell.runCommand`)

    Show command history and let you select, modify & run a command

* `EditWithShell: Clear Command History` (**Command ID:** `editWithShell.clearCommandHistory`)

    Clear command history

* `EditWithShell: Run quick command 1` (**Command ID:** `editWithShell.runQuickCommand1`)

    Run quick command 1. **You have quick commands up to 25**, i.e. `editWithShell.runQuickCommand25`

## Configurations

* `editWithShell.currentDirectoryKind` (default: `"currentFile"`)

    Current directory for shell commands. If the target directory is not available, HOME directory will be used. Possible values: `currentFile` or `workspaceRoot`

    Commands listed by default in the history and activable by quick commands. Each element must have a property `command`. In order to be used as a quick command, the property `id` must be set. Also, it can optionally have the boolean property `processEntireTextIfNoneSelected` (it'll override the extension setting `editWithShell.processEntireTextIfNoneSelected`).

    ```
    "editWithShell.favoriteCommands": [
      {
        "command": "cut -d, -f3 | sort",
